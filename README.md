# The Language Lion
*Learning Dutch from English with personalized, automatically generated exercises.*

This is - before anything else - a research project. Do not expect this app to make you a fluent Dutch speaker. Do expect rough edges. While this app is not intended for private use, anyone is free to download the APK from the Releases tab.

Full project documentation is coming soon. For now, if you're interested in the exercise generation library behind the app, check out the [Language Lion Generator](https://github.com/rayoverweij/language-lion-generator).
