# The Language Lion &mdash; learn Dutch from scratch through automatically generated exercises
**This is - before anything else - a research project. Do not expect this app to make you into a fluent Dutch speaker. Do expect rough edges. While this app is not intended for private use, anyone is free to download the APK from the Releases tab.**

The Language Lion is an Android app that teaches Dutch. It assumes no prior knowledge of the language&mdash;just open the app, choose for how long you want to practice, and for the duration of that time the app will automatically generate exercises based on your progress.

This application was built in partial fulfilment of an undergraduate Senior Project for Bard College. For detailed information on this project, including its original vision, discussions on the linguistic philosophy behind it, and notes on testing and evaluation, read the official [research paper](https://rayo.dev/docs/Verweij2020-TheLanguageLion.pdf).

## Getting started
To install the app, download the APK from the Releases tab and install it on your device. The Language Lion is compatible with phones running Android 6.0+.

To build the project yourself, clone or download the project into Android Studio. All necessary libraries are included.

To inspect or see the natural language generation library behind the app, check out the [Language Lion Generator](https://github.com/rayoverweij/language-lion-generator).
